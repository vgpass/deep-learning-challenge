[COMPLETED ALPHABET SOUP CHARITY ANALYSIS](https://github.com/vgpass/credit-risk-classification)

## ***INTRODUCTION***

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup funds a variety of ventures across numerous classifications ranging from private to public, company-funded to independent, and with a wide range of income needs. Some of these organizations have income in the billions or dollars, others are pure-nonprofits with no income at all. Some are looking for small grant amounts and others are funding product development in the billions of dollars.

The foundation has had mixed results over the years and is looking for a way to better select the organizations with the best chance of success in meeting their fundraising goals. The Alphabet Soup business team has a dataset that contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding in the past and identifies whether they have been successful or not. The team has decided to use machine learning and neural networks to analyze the features in the data and create a binary classifier that seeks to predict whether applicants will be succesful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The metadata in our possession has the following features.

* EIN and NAME—Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
* USE_CASE—Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION—Organization type
* STATUS—Active status
* INCOME_AMT—Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
* ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
